Level 3: Integration with Other Concepts Prompt

Here are my answers to the Level 2 assessment questions:

[Paste the assessment_questions array with added "user_answers" field for each question]

Based on my answers, please:

1. Evaluate my advanced understanding
2. Provide feedback on my analysis skills and critical thinking
3. Score my progress on a scale of 1-10 with detailed comparison to previous levels
4. Show how this concept integrates with the next key concept from the original overview
5. Provide content on the relationships and interactions between these concepts
6. Create questions that require understanding both concepts together
7. Only use MCQ and MAQ type questions

Return ONLY this JSON structure:
