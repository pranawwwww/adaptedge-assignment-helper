Level 4: Practical Application Prompt

Here are my answers to the Level 3 assessment questions:

[Paste the assessment_questions array with added "user_answers" field for each question]

Based on my answers, please:

1. Evaluate my understanding of both concepts and their integration
2. Provide feedback on my systems thinking and design decisions
3. Score my progress on a scale of 1-10 with comparison to all previous levels
4. Provide detailed real-world application scenarios with implementation frameworks
5. Create practical, scenario-based questions that simulate actual assignment problems
6. These should be complex enough to prepare me for the final assignment
7. Only use MCQ and MAQ type questions

Return ONLY this JSON structure:
