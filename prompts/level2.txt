Level 2: Advanced Concept Understanding Prompt

Here are my answers to the Level 1 assessment questions:

[Paste the assessment_questions array with added "user_answers" field for each question]

Based on my answers, please:

1. Evaluate my understanding at this more challenging level
2. Provide detailed feedback emphasizing nuances I may have missed
3. Score my progress on a scale of 1-10 with comparison to previous level
4. Introduce more advanced aspects of the concept including edge cases and optimizations
5. Create new questions that require deeper analysis and application
6. Only use MCQ and MAQ type questions

Return ONLY this JSON structure:
